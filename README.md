# Tailwind CLI Boilerplate

## Development

To compile and watch CSS changes during development, run:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```

This command will keep Tailwind CSS watching your files and automatically recompiling the CSS as you work on your project.
